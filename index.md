## What I do

My engineering journey began over two decades ago with self-directed programming and a passion for building systems that work reliably at scale. Early roles in technical operations and customer support taught me the value of process improvement, automation, and connecting people with better tools.

Today, as a Staff Software Engineer, I apply that systems-aware mindset to architect scalable backend platforms, lead cross-functional initiatives, and mentor engineers. I focus on clarity, pragmatism, and impact—helping teams build resilient, production-grade software.

Whether improving deployment workflows, designing integrations, or optimizing performance, I bring a practical approach grounded in deep experience and curiosity.

## What I Bring

- Deep expertise in Ruby, TypeScript, Python, and Java across diverse SaaS and enterprise environments  
- Proven track record of leading large-scale system migrations and service design  
- Strong cross-team coordination bridging engineering, product, and operations  
- A systems-aware mindset with a focus on edge cases, performance, and maintainability  
- Passion for mentoring and cultivating technical excellence and team growth
