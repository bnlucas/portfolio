## Who I Am

Iâ€™m a **Staff Software Engineer** passionate about building scalable backend systems, cloud-native microservices, and robust API platforms in dynamic, high-growth SaaS environments. My career journey, from customer support to engineering leadership, has shaped a systems-aware mindset and a keen intuition for edge cases, reliability, and maintainability.

I thrive on architecting complex integrations, leading cross-functional initiatives, and mentoring engineers to elevate team delivery and code quality. Driven by curiosity, clarity, and pragmatism, I focus on improving the structure and resilience of the systems and practices I engage with. My commitment is to foster technical excellence and build production-grade systems that move the needle.

## My Expertise

My experience covers the full software lifecycle, with a focus on backend and platform engineering:

- **Languages & Frameworks:** Ruby (Rails), TypeScript (Node.js & React), Python (Django & FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot)  
- **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Jenkins, Datadog  
- **Databases:** MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **Practices & Methodologies:** Microservices Architecture, RESTful APIs, System Design, Data Migrations, Performance Tuning, Test Automation, Agile/Scrum, Code Review & Mentorship, Process & Platform Automation

## Driving Impact as a Staff Engineer

As a Staff Software Engineer, I focus on solving complex challenges and driving measurable impact by:

- **Architecting Scalable Transitions:** Leading strategic shifts from monoliths to agile microservices, accelerating development cycles and improving system resilience. For example, I spearheaded migrations that cut deployment times from hours to minutes and unlocked faster time-to-market.  
- **Optimizing Performance and Reliability:** Tackling bottlenecks in databases and distributed systems to drastically improve performance and stability, including SQL query tuning that reduced reporting times by 99 percent.  
- **Building Resilient Integrations and Platforms:** Designing robust integrations and security measures such as RabbitMQ-powered third-party connections and company-wide JWT standards that protect system integrity and support business growth.  
- **Empowering Teams Through Mentorship and Best Practices:** Shaping engineering culture through mentorship, architectural guidance, and codifying standards that elevate code quality and streamline onboarding.  
- **Automating for Efficiency:** Engineering automation to eliminate manual errors, save operational hours, and free teams to focus on high-impact work.

These efforts reflect my dedication to improving foundational systems and elevating engineering practices beyond individual features.
