<h2>Additional Background</h2>
<p>My formal engineering career began in 2018, building on decades of self-directed programming and several years in technical operations and customer-facing roles. That path shaped my systems-aware mindset and a practical intuition for edge cases, reliability, and supportability.</p>
<p>Progressing from Tier 1 Support to Staff Engineer, I have consistently focused on improving the structure and quality of the systems I work with. Whether through service architecture, developer tooling, or deployment processes, I approach engineering with curiosity, clarity, and pragmatism to help teams scale their code and their practices.</p>
