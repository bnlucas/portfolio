    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
<p>Iâ€™m a <strong>Staff Software Engineer</strong> passionate about building scalable backend systems, cloud-native microservices, and robust API platforms in dynamic, high-growth SaaS environments. My career journey, from customer support to engineering leadership, has shaped a systems-aware mindset and a keen intuition for edge cases, reliability, and maintainability.</p>
<p>I thrive on architecting complex integrations, leading cross-functional initiatives, and mentoring engineers to elevate team delivery and code quality. Driven by curiosity, clarity, and pragmatism, I focus on improving the structure and resilience of the systems and practices I engage with. My commitment is to foster technical excellence and build production-grade systems that move the needle.</p>
<h2>My Expertise</h2>
<p>My experience covers the full software lifecycle, with a focus on backend and platform engineering:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Languages &amp; Frameworks:</strong> Ruby (Rails), TypeScript (Node.js &amp; React), Python (Django &amp; FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot)</li>
<li><strong>Cloud &amp; Infrastructure:</strong> AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Jenkins, Datadog</li>
<li><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB</li>
<li><strong>Practices &amp; Methodologies:</strong> Microservices Architecture, RESTful APIs, System Design, Data Migrations, Performance Tuning, Test Automation, Agile/Scrum, Code Review &amp; Mentorship, Process &amp; Platform Automation</li>
</ul>
<h2>Driving Impact as a Staff Engineer</h2>
<p>As a Staff Software Engineer, I focus on solving complex challenges and driving measurable impact by:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecting Scalable Transitions:</strong> Leading strategic shifts from monoliths to agile microservices, accelerating development cycles and improving system resilience. For example, I spearheaded migrations that cut deployment times from hours to minutes and unlocked faster time-to-market.</li>
<li><strong>Optimizing Performance and Reliability:</strong> Tackling bottlenecks in databases and distributed systems to drastically improve performance and stability, including SQL query tuning that reduced reporting times by 99 percent.</li>
<li><strong>Building Resilient Integrations and Platforms:</strong> Designing robust integrations and security measures such as RabbitMQ-powered third-party connections and company-wide JWT standards that protect system integrity and support business growth.</li>
<li><strong>Empowering Teams Through Mentorship and Best Practices:</strong> Shaping engineering culture through mentorship, architectural guidance, and codifying standards that elevate code quality and streamline onboarding.</li>
<li><strong>Automating for Efficiency:</strong> Engineering automation to eliminate manual errors, save operational hours, and free teams to focus on high-impact work.</li>
</ul>
<p>These efforts reflect my dedication to improving foundational systems and elevating engineering practices beyond individual features.</p>
