<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a <strong>Staff Software Engineer</strong> with a passion for building scalable backend systems, cloud-native microservices, and robust API platforms in dynamic, high-growth SaaS environments. My journey through various technical roles, from customer support to engineering leadership, has instilled a deep, systems-aware mindset and an intuition for edge cases, reliability, and supportability.</p>
<p>I thrive on architecting complex integrations, leading cross-functional initiatives, and mentoring engineers to elevate team delivery and code quality. My approach to engineering is driven by curiosity, clarity, and a pragmatic focus on impact, consistently aiming to improve the structure and quality of the systems and practices I engage with. I'm dedicated to fostering technical excellence and team growth, ensuring resilient, production-grade systems that truly move the needle.</p>
<hr>
<h2>My Expertise</h2>
<p>My experience spans the full software development lifecycle, with a particular focus on backend and platform engineering.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Languages &amp; Frameworks</strong>: Ruby (Rails), TypeScript (Node.js &amp; React), Python (Django &amp; FastAPI), Java (Spring Boot)</li>
<li><strong>Cloud &amp; Infrastructure</strong>: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines, Kafka, RabbitMQ, Jenkins, Datadog</li>
<li><strong>Databases</strong>: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB</li>
<li><strong>Practices &amp; Methodologies</strong>: Microservices Architecture, RESTful APIs, System Design, Data Migrations, Performance Tuning, Test Automation, Agile/Scrum, Code Review &amp; Mentorship, Process &amp; Platform Automation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Driving Impact as a Staff Engineer</h2>
<p>My journey as a Staff Software Engineer has centered on solving complex problems, fostering technical excellence, and driving measurable impact across teams and systems. I approach engineering challenges with a focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Architecting Scalable Transitions:</strong> Leading strategic shifts in core systems, from monolithic architectures to agile microservices, to unlock faster development cycles and enhance system resilience. For example, I've spearheaded large-scale migrations that transformed multi-hour deployment cadences into rapid, on-demand releases, significantly accelerating time-to-market.</li>
<li><strong>Optimizing Performance and Reliability:</strong> Deep diving into critical system bottlenecks, from database queries to distributed messaging, to drastically improve performance and ensure operational stability. This includes optimizing data processes that cut critical reporting times by 99% and enhancing observability across complex platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Building Resilient Integrations &amp; Platforms:</strong> Designing and implementing robust integrations and platform-level security measures that directly serve business growth and fortify system integrity. My work has involved leveraging technologies like RabbitMQ for strategic third-party connections and establishing robust JSON Web Tokens (JWT) standards across service ecosystems.</li>
<li><strong>Empowering Teams Through Mentorship &amp; Best Practices:</strong> Actively shaping engineering culture through mentorship, guiding architectural decisions, and codifying development standards. I've focused on practices that not only elevate code quality and team delivery but also streamline onboarding and foster long-term maintainability.</li>
<li><strong>Automating for Efficiency:</strong> Identifying manual pain points and engineering automated solutions that eliminate errors, save significant operational hours, and free up resources for higher-value work.</li>
</ul>
<p>These efforts reflect my dedication to moving beyond individual features to improve foundational systems and elevate engineering practices.</p>

<h2>Open Source Contributions</h2>
<p>I actively maintain and contribute to open-source software focused on developer ergonomics, structured data modeling, and runtime efficiency. Below are some projects I’ve authored or led that address gaps I encountered in real-world systems.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/bnlucas/obfuskey">Obfuskey</a> • Python</h3>
<p>A compact library for <strong>reversible, fixed-length obfuscated key generation</strong> from integers. It also supports <strong>bit-packing multiple values</strong> into single, compact identifiers using custom schemas.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/bnlucas/obfuskey-js">Obfuskey.js</a> • TypeScript</h3>
<p>A cross-platform port of the Python Obfuskey for JavaScript/TypeScript environments. It provides <strong>reversible, fixed-length obfuscated key generation</strong> and <strong>bit-packing of multiple values</strong> into compact identifiers, leveraging <code>BigInt</code> for arbitrary precision.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/bnlucas/cattri">Cattri</a> • Ruby</h3>
<p>A lightweight Ruby DSL for defining <strong>flexible class and instance attributes</strong>. It supports inheritance, lazy defaults, <strong><code>final</code> (write-once) values</strong>, and fine-grained control over <strong>visibility and coercion</strong>, enabling structured data patterns.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/bnlucas/castkit">Castkit</a> • Ruby</h3>
<p>A lightweight <strong>type-safe data transfer object (DTO) and contract system</strong> for Ruby. It offers a declarative approach to structured data with <strong>built-in typecasting, validation, and serialization</strong>, designed for robust service boundaries.</p>
<h3><a href="https://github.com/bnlucas/gaskit">Gaskit</a> • Ruby</h3>
<p>A flexible framework for <strong>composable operations and service objects</strong> in Ruby. It promotes structured application logic through <strong>step pipelines, robust error handling with early exits, and integrated logging and duration tracking</strong>.</p>
<p>These libraries were developed independently and are not affiliated with any employer. Each reflects my commitment to clarity, performance, and maintainability.</p>
